For 3 questions, I used 
- Tailwindcss to style components
- Postcss to pre-procces CSS
- redux for state management in project
- redux-saga for calling API

Room for improvement, because I don't have enough time so still have some places need to do
- Unit test for component
- Unit test for service
- organize structure should be clean.
